    m_Localized: "<color=#610078><align=left><size=60>Application for Registration</size></align></color>\r\n\r\nEmployers
      have a legal responsibility to request and sign the registration of their employees
      in the Special Employment System for Domestic Workers. This obligation extends
      to the submission and signing of resignations and data variations related to
      the employment status of the staff.\r\n\r\nEmployers are required to request
      and sign the registration, resignation, and variations of data for their employees.
      If this obligation is not fulfilled, the employee may directly request their
      affiliation with the General Treasury of Social Security (TGSS).\r\n\r\nThis
      must be requested at the General Treasury of Social Security offices, in advance
      of the start of the work activity.\r\n\r\nThe resignation request and data
      variations must be submitted within 3 calendar days following the cessation
      of work or the date on which the variation occurs, through the Import@ss platform.\r\n\r\n<color=#610078><align=left><size=60>Import@ss</size></align></color>\r\n\r\nRegistering
      a person in the Special Employment System for Domestic Workers is easier than
      ever thanks to Import@ss, the new portal of the General Treasury of Social
      Security (TGSS) that allows you to complete the process in just 9 steps without
      having to provide documentation, although you will need to have a series of
      data prepared. You can do this anytime, from any computer or mobile device
      with an internet connection.\r\n\r\nYou can access Import@ss directly from
      this link or from the access points enabled on the website, the electronic
      headquarters, and the Social Security mobile application. To request registration,
      you must identify yourself using the following methods:\r\n\r\n\u25CF Electronic
      certificate\r\n\r\n\u25CF Cl@ve\r\n\r\n\u25CF Via SMS\r\n\r\n<color=blue><align=left><u><link=https://portal.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/importass/importass>https://portal.seg-social.gob.es/wps/portal/importass/importass</link></u></align></color>\r\n\r\nSo
      far, employment relationships in the domestic sector have represented a high
      percentage of in-person processing and difficulties in digital processing,
      as they could require up to three additional procedures to the registration
      itself if the worker and/or the employer do not have a Social Security Number
      (NUSS) and the employer does not have a Contribution Account Code (CCC).\r\n\r\nIn
      Import@ss, the process adapts to the user's circumstances, creating the Social
      Security Number and the Contribution Account Code if necessary. The process
      is designed so that the user, from the public or personal area, can complete
      a registration in a single flow with a maximum of 9 steps, divided by the type
      of information requested from the user.\r\n\r\n<color=#610078><align=left><size=60>Steps
      to Register</size></align></color>\r\n\r\nOnce you have accessed the domestic
      employment registration service in Import@ss and identified yourself or accessed
      your personal area, you must first indicate whether you are processing the
      registration as an employer or as a worker. The system will give you the option
      to process a new registration or continue with one you have previously started.\r\n\r\nNext,
      you simply need to fill out the 9 steps in which clarity of information, ease
      of use, control over each of the steps, and security of the process stand out:\r\n\r\n1.
      Employee's data: Type and number of identification document (DNI or NIE) and
      date of birth.\r\n\r\n2. Employer's data: Indicate whether the employee will
      care for a large family. If you meet the conditions, you may be entitled to
      a bonus.\r\n\r\n3. Duration of the contract: Indicate the start date of the
      activity and the type of contract (indefinite or fixed-term).\r\n\r\n4. Work
      schedule and salary: You must mark whether the contract is full-time or hourly,
      the number of hours worked per week/month, how the salary payment has been
      agreed (monthly or weekly), the salary they will receive, whether they will
      receive a salary during vacations, whether extra payments are included, whether
      guard hours will be worked, or if payment in kind has been agreed (the system
      will inform you of the fee to be paid based on this data). Remember that the
      salary must be at least equal to the SMI (if it is full-time).\r\n\r\n5. Activity
      address: Fill in the details or select the activity address if it matches any
      of those registered in the TGSS database.\r\n\r\n6. Insurer: Select the insurance
      entity, choosing between the INSS or a collaborating Mutual.\r\n\r\n7. Contact
      information: Enter the contact details as the domestic employer.\r\n\r\n8.
      Bank account: You must provide the account where the corresponding monthly
      fee will be charged.\r\n\r\n9. Review your data: Import@ss will offer you a
      summary of all fields, which you can modify if you detect any errors.\r\n\r\nSteps
      may be omitted if the TGSS already has the corresponding information.\r\n\r\nIf
      the data is correct, you must give your consent after reading and accepting
      the responsible declaration by marking the corresponding box. Once done, you
      can proceed to sign the request and request registration; the system will show
      you a receipt and offer you the option to download the supporting documentation
      in PDF format.\r\n\r\nLink to explanatory video of the step-by-step process:
      \r\n\r\n<color=blue><align=left><u><link=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX2fshb4dPk>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX2fshb4dPk</link></u></align></color>\r\n\r\nWithout
      identification method\r\n\r\nIf you do not have any of the previous identification
      methods, you can use the request submission service on the portal, where you
      can request registration using this form without prior identification. You
      can also process resignations and modifications of data.\r\n\r\nTo process
      the registration, you must complete and attach:\r\n\r\n1. Employer's data:
      personal details, address, Contribution Account Code (CCC), banking details
      for fee collection, copy of identification document.\r\n\r\n2. Employee's data:
      personal details, copy of identification document, and Social Security Number
      (NUSS).\r\n\r\n3. Labor relationship data (number of hours worked, salary,
      start date of the labor relationship, whether there are any payments in kind,
      overnight stays, etc.).\r\n\r\n4. The employment contract.\r\n\r\n<color=blue><align=left><u><link=https://www.sepe.es/HomeSepe/empresas/Contratos-de-trabajo/modelos-contrato.html>https://www.sepe.es/HomeSepe/empresas/Contratos-de-trabajo/modelos-contrato.html</link></u></align></color>\r\n\r\n5.

      If this is the first time you are hiring a domestic employee, you must also
      submit Model TA.6-0138 HOGAR Request for Contribution Account Code.\r\n\r\n<color=blue><align=left><u><link=https://tinyurl.com/57pxkr6s>https://tinyurl.com/57pxkr6s</link></u></align></color>\r\n\r\n7.
      Additionally, if the employee does not have a Social Security affiliation number,
      it should be processed using Model TA 1.\r\n\r\n<color=blue><align=left><u><link=https://www.seg-social.es/wps/portal/wss/internet/Trabajadores/Afiliacion/10817/31190/572>https://www.seg-social.es/wps/portal/wss/internet/Trabajadores/Afiliacion/10817/31190/572</link></u></align></color>\r\n\r\nTo
      guide you through the process, you can use the virtual assistant available
      on the website and in the Electronic Headquarters of Social Security. It will
      show you the steps to follow, the necessary requirements, and links to the
      electronic headquarters for submitting requests.\r\n\r\n<color=#610078><align=left><size=60>Deadlines</size></align></color>\r\n\r\nIn
      any of the previous cases, registration must be processed before the start
      of the work activity, with a maximum advance of 60 days, and it is the responsibility
      of the employer, just like the payment of contributions.\r\n\r\nRemember that,
      since January 1, 2023, it is no longer possible to agree with domestic workers
      who perform less than 60 hours of work per month per employer to assume the
      obligations regarding contributions, affiliation, and registration in Social
      Security, as could be done until now, after the entry into force of some of
      the novelties of Royal Decree-Law 16/2022, of September 6, which improves working
      conditions for this group, including unemployment protection.\r\n\r\n<color=#610078><align=left><size=60>Essential
      Elements and Forms of the Contract</size></align></color>\r\n\r\n\u25CF Orally:
      contracts shorter than four weeks (at any time, it can be required that it
      be formalized in writing).\r\n\r\n\u25CF In writing: contracts lasting four
      weeks or more.\r\n\r\nThe contract must be made in writing, with one copy for
      the employer and another for the employee. It is important to do this because
      if the contract is not formalized in writing, it is presumed that the employment
      relationship is indefinite and full-time.\r\n\r\n<color=blue><align=left><u><link=https://www.mites.gob.es/es/portada/serviciohogar/nueva-regulacion/contratacion/index.htm>https://www.mites.gob.es/es/portada/serviciohogar/nueva-regulacion/contratacion/index.htm</link></u></align></color>\r\n\r\nWhen
      the duration of the contract is more than four weeks, the worker must receive
      information about the essential elements of the contract if they are not included
      in the written contract formalized, which, in addition to general aspects (identification
      of the parties, salary, working hours, etc.), will include:\r\n\r\n\u25CF Salary
      payments in kind, when their existence has been agreed upon.\r\n\r\n\u25CF
      Payments in kind must be specifically valued, detailing the amount and frequency
      of the remuneration.\r\n\r\nThe written contract must also specify the following
      information:\r\n\r\n\u25CF Employment start date, with reference to whether
      it is indefinite or temporary.\r\n\r\n\u25CF The work schedule (the hours and
      days of the week that the worker will perform their duties).\r\n\r\n\u25CF
      The maximum number of working hours, as well as the specific duties to be carried
      out by the employee.\r\n\r\nLastly, it\u2019s advisable to keep a record of
      all the communications with the employee, whether by email or message, to avoid
      any misunderstandings or disputes.\r\n\r\n<color=#610078><align=left><size=60>Rights
      and Obligations</size></align></color>\r\n\r\nThe employer must comply with
      their obligations regarding the employee, including the timely payment of salary
      and contributions to the Social Security system.\r\n\r\nThe employee has the
      right to a fair salary and to receive the agreed payment on time. They also
      have the right to a safe and healthy work environment.\r\n\r\nFor any conflicts
      that arise, both parties should try to resolve the issue amicably before considering
      legal action. If necessary, they can contact labor inspectors or seek legal
      advice.\r\n\r\n<color=#610078><align=left><size=60>Contact Information</size></align></color>\r\n\r\nIf
      you have any questions or need further assistance, you can contact the General

      hours are those that exceed the ordinary working hours established in the contract.
      It is important to remember that the ordinary working day cannot exceed 40
      hours per week, and any hour worked beyond this limit is considered extraordinary.\r\n\r\nExtraordinary
      hours are different from periods of availability; they must be paid separately
      and cannot exceed 80 hours per year.\r\n\r\nAccording to Article 15 of the
      Workers' Statute, extraordinary hours must be paid at least at the same value
      as one ordinary hour of the Minimum Interprofessional Salary.\r\n\r\nIn addition
      to cash payment, the employer can opt to compensate extraordinary hours with
      equivalent rest days, offering free time for the extraordinary hours worked.\r\n\r\nThere
      is a limit of 80 extraordinary hours per year; however, if the option to compensate
      extraordinary hours with free time is chosen, these do not count within the

      workers: They will have 2 hours each day for main meals. These rest periods
      do not count as working time.\r\n\r\n\u25CF Weekly rest: 36 consecutive hours.\r\n\r\nSOURCES:\r\n\r\n<color=blue><u><link=https://www.caritasalamanca.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FOLLETO-INFORMATIVO-2024.pdf>https://www.caritasalamanca.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FOLLETO-INFORMATIVO-2024.pdf</link>\r\n\r\n<link=https://www.cuestioneslaborales.es/las-horas-extraordinarias-las-empleadas-del-hogar/>https://www.cuestioneslaborales.es/las-horas-extraordinarias-las-empleadas-del-hogar/</link>\r\n\r\n<link=https://www.cuestioneslaborales.es/horario-de-las-empleadas-del-hogar-internas/>https://www.cuestioneslaborales.es/horario-de-las-empleadas-del-hogar-internas/</link>\r\n\r\n<link=https://www.cuestioneslaborales.es/el-regimen-laboral-de-las-empleadas-del-hogar/#descanso>https://www.cuestioneslaborales.es/el-regimen-laboral-de-las-empleadas-del-hogar/#descanso</link></u></color>\r\n"

      All workers have the right to enjoy at least 30 calendar days of vacation per
      year. This right is maintained regardless of the number of weekly working hours
      or the type of contract (full-time, part-time, or half-time).\r\n\r\n    These
      30 days are accrued throughout the working year, with each month of work generating
      2.5 vacation days.\r\n\r\n    During vacation days, the employee is entitled
      to receive the same salary they would if they were working.\r\n\r\n    There
      is also a right to enjoy 14 public holidays per year, like the rest of the
      workers. The labor calendar varies according to the autonomous community and
      locality.\r\n\r\n<color=#610078><align=left><size=60>How can I enjoy my vacation?</size></align></color>\r\n\r\n   
      Vacations can be divided into fractions as convenient. Legislation establishes
      that at least 15 calendar days must be taken consecutively. However, in practice,
      other arrangements can be agreed upon between both parties.\r\n\r\n    It is
      important to highlight that all vacations must be taken within the same calendar
      year in which they were accrued; they cannot be accumulated from one year to
      another.\r\n\r\n<color=#610078><align=left><size=60>Obligations during Vacation</size></align></color>\r\n\r\n   
      During vacations, the employee has no labor obligations to the employer. It
      is a rest period in which they are not expected to perform any work-related
      tasks.\r\n\r\n    For live-in employees, this means they are not obliged to
      reside at the family home or any other place associated with the job during
      this time.\r\n\r\n    If the employer's family goes on vacation to another
      place and the employee travels with them, does this time count as vacation?
      No, vacation time is rest time for the employee; therefore, if they accompany
      the family during their vacation and continue to perform their work functions
      at the location where the family is traveling, this time does not count as
      vacation but rather as work.\r\n\r\n    Should the live-in employee accompany
      the employer's family to the home during the family's vacation? The rules regarding
      overnight stays for live-in employees are part of the essential elements of
      the contract, so if during a period of the year these overnight stays must
      occur in a place different from the usual residence, this matter should be
      specified in the contract.\r\n\r\n    In any case, this time will not count
      as vacation for the employee as long as they continue to carry out their work
      tasks.\r\n\r\n<color=#610078><align=left><size=60>Paid Leave for Domestic Workers</size></align></color>\r\n\r\n   
      People working in domestic employment have the right to certain paid leave
      that allows them to perform their work without jeopardizing their labor and
      economic stability. These leaves are provided for in the Workers' Statute and
      cover a series of situations:\r\n\r\n\u25CF Marriage: 15 calendar days\r\n\r\n\u25CF
      Family reasons: 2 days (if the worker needs to travel, the leave is extended
      to 4 calendar days)\r\n\r\n\u25CB Death \r\n\r\n\u25CB Serious accident or
      illness\r\n\r\n\u25CB Hospitalization\r\n\r\n\u25CB Surgical intervention without
      hospitalization that requires home rest for relatives up to the second degree
      of consanguinity or affinity\r\n\r\n\u25CF Moving house: 1 day of leave\r\n\r\n\u25CF
      Right to be absent due to an unavoidable duty: the right to be absent from
      work for the necessary time to fulfill an unavoidable public and personal duty,
      including active suffrage, is recognized.\r\n\r\n\u25CF Leave related to pregnancy
      and infant care: during pregnancy, domestic workers have the right to the necessary
      leave to attend prenatal examinations and childbirth preparation techniques.\r\n\r\n\u25CF
      Birth, adoption, custody for adoption purposes, or fostering: 1 hour of absence
      from work is granted, which can be divided into two parts, for the care of
      the infant until they reach 9 months. The duration of the leave will increase
      proportionally in the case of multiple births, adoptions, custody for adoption
      purposes, or fostering.\r\n\r\nSOURCES:\r\n\r\n<color=blue><align=left><u><link=https://www.caritasalamanca.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FOLLETO-INFORMATIVO-2024.pdf>https://www.caritasalamanca.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/FOLLETO-INFORMATIVO-2024.pdf</link>\r\n\r\n<link=https://www.mites.gob.es/es/portada/serviciohogar/preguntas-frecuentes/tiempo-trabajo/index.htm>https://www.mites.gob.es/es/portada/serviciohogar/preguntas-frecuentes/tiempo-trabajo/index.htm</link>\r\n\r\n<link=https://www.cuestioneslaborales.es/las-vacaciones-las-empleadas-del-hogar/#horas>https://www.cuestioneslaborales.es/las-vacaciones-las-empleadas-del-hogar/#horas</link>\r\n\r\n<link=https://www.boe.es/buscar/pdf/2015/BOE-A-2015-11430-consolidado.pdf>https://www.boe.es/buscar/pdf/2015/BOE-A-2015-11430-consolidado.pdf</link></u></align></color>\r\n"

      New Medical Leave Regulations</size></align></color>\r\n\r\n    The new Royal
      Decree 1060/2022 introduces major changes that directly affect the management
      of temporary disability situations (medical leave), including in the domestic
      workers sector. The significant changes introduced by this new regulation are:\r\n\r\n\u25CF
      The obligation for the worker to submit the medical leave report to their employer
      is eliminated. The medical leave report for companies/employers is removed.
      Instead, the doctor will be responsible for providing the medical leave report
      to the worker and communicating the leave data to the INSS or mutuals, which
      in turn will transmit the information to employers electronically.\r\n\r\n\u25CF
      Doctors may establish shorter medical review periods than those officially
      set, as long as they align with the progress of the condition.\r\n\r\n\u25CF
      The data that companies must transmit to Social Security are modified.\r\n\r\n   
      Among these changes, the one that most directly affects the domestic workers
      sector is related to medical reports. Until now, when a worker went to their
      general practitioner or mutual to collect their sick leave, confirmation, or
      discharge reports, the doctor always provided the worker with two copies: one
      copy for the worker and another copy for the company. The worker then had 3
      days to provide this report to the company, so that the company would be aware
      of the situation and could take the necessary steps.\r\n\r\n    With the entry
      into force of this new Royal Decree on April 1, 2023, the only report issued
      by the general practitioner will be the worker's copy. This report is confidential
      for the worker and does not need to be provided to the company.\r\n\r\n   
      Therefore, as of April 1, the general practitioner communicates the medical
      leave data to the INSS electronically within 24 working hours of the appointment
      with the worker. Once the data is received, the INSS transmits this information
      to the employers.\r\n\r\n<color=#610078><align=left><size=60>B. Temporary Disability
      and Medical Leave</size></align></color>\r\n\r\n    When a worker enters a
      temporary disability situation, the employer must initiate several important
      steps. First, they must stay informed about the worker\u2019s leave situation
      (leave dates and confirmations), as these will be necessary for adjusting the
      medical leave.\r\n\r\n    During the medical leave period, the worker is not
      obliged to provide services and is entitled to receive financial compensation
      for temporary disability, the amount of which will depend on the regulatory
      base and the duration of the leave.\r\n\r\n    The employer must be informed
      about the entity responsible for covering common and professional contingencies.
      This entity can be the INSS or a Mutual Collaborator of Social Security. When
      registering as a domestic employer, one of these options must be chosen.\r\n\r\n<color=#610078><align=left><size=60>C.
      Coverage of Common Contingencies</size></align></color>\r\n\r\n    In the case
      of common contingencies, which include temporary disability coverage for common
      illness or non-occupational accident, the general practitioner will be the
      one to issue the medical leave report to the worker, carry out the reviews,
      and determine when they can issue the medical discharge.\r\n\r\n    Regarding
      the caregiver's payroll management, it should be noted that:\r\n\r\n\u25CF
      The worker does not receive a salary for the first 3 days of leave.\r\n\r\n\u25CF
      From the 4th to the 8th day, they will receive 60% of the contribution base
      from the employer.\r\n\r\n\u25CF From the 9th day onward, the worker will receive
      a benefit directly from the entity covering common contingencies. In this case,
      the worker must go to the nearest INSS/Mutual to manage the payment of their
      benefit, providing the employer with an employer certificate to process the
      payment.\r\n\r\n    It is important to highlight that, to be eligible for the
      benefit, the worker must have contributed for 180 days in the last 6 years.
      If this requirement is not met, the worker will not receive any benefits during
      their medical leave.\r\n"

    m_Localized: "<color=#610078><align=left><size=60>D. Coverage of Professional
      Contingencies</size></align></color>\r\n\r\n    Professional contingencies
      refer to protection in cases of work-related accidents, defined as \"any bodily
      injury that the worker suffers on the occasion of or as a consequence of the
      work performed for others\" (art. 115 LGSS). If a worker suffers a work-related
      accident, they must go directly to the entity responsible for the corresponding
      coverage.\r\n\r\n    If the coverage of professional contingencies is handled
      by the INSS, the worker must go to the general practitioner to obtain the medical
      leave report, and the same doctor will be responsible for the reviews and the
      discharge report. If the coverage is provided by a mutual insurance company,
      the mutual's doctor will issue the medical leave report and carry out the relevant
      reviews.\r\n\r\n    Regarding compensation for work-related accidents, the
      employer will cover the first day of leave at 100%, while from the second day
      onward, the INSS or the mutual will be responsible for direct payment. The
      employer must prepare the employer's certificate and provide it to the worker
      so they can manage the payment of their compensation.\r\n\r\n    In the case
      of work-related accidents, the employer is obligated to report the accident
      through the Delt@ System within 5 working days from the date of the accident
      or from when they become aware of it.\r\n"

      Termination in Home Employment</color></size></align>\r\n\r\nOne of the main
      demands in the domestic employment sector was the abolition of the legal concept
      of termination without cause, which allowed employers to terminate the employment
      contract without needing to justify the reason. This concept was almost exclusive
      to the household sector, since, as a rule in labor law, dismissals must be
      justified by one of the reasons outlined in the Workers' Statute.\r\n\r\n<color=#610078></align=left><size=60>b.
      Reasons for Termination in Home Employment</color></size></align>\r\n\r\nAs
      of September 9, 2022, the concept of termination without cause was abolished,
      removing the possibility for employers to terminate contracts without justification.
      The new reasons for termination in domestic employment must always be motivated
      and justified.\r\n\r\nThese reasons include:\r\n\r\n- **Objective termination
      due to a decrease in income or increase in expenses in the family unit:** 
      \r\n  The contract can be terminated when, due to unforeseen circumstances,
      the family's income decreases or their expenses increase, such as when a family
      member loses a job or an unexpected expense occurs.\r\n\r\n- **Objective termination
      due to changes in family needs:**  \r\n  The contract can be terminated when
      the family makes a decision that affects its structure, like deciding to place
      an elderly family member in a specialized care center.\r\n\r\n- **Objective
      termination due to loss of trust in the employee's conduct:**  \r\n  There
      must be a serious cause attributed to the employee that leads to a genuine
      loss of trust, justifying the decision to end the employment.\r\n\r\n<color=#610078></align=left><size=60>c.
      Voluntary Resignation:</color></size></align>\r\n\r\nVoluntary resignation
      occurs when a household employee notifies the employer, either in writing or
      verbally, of their decision to end the employment relationship. In this case,
      the decision comes from the employee, and the employer only needs to be informed.
      The resignation process requires fulfilling certain requirements and considering
      specific factors.\r\n\r\nKey features include:\r\n\r\n- The notice must be
      given 15 calendar days in advance.\r\n- The company must still pay a final
      settlement even in cases of voluntary resignation.\r\n- The resignation is
      reversible within 15 days.\r\n- A new contract must be signed if the employee
      wishes to return to the same employer.\r\n\r\nEmployees must sign the voluntary
      resignation form willingly, without pressure or external causes, as any form
      of coercion is illegal. Additionally, voluntary resignations disqualify the
      employee from claiming unemployment benefits, except when they find a new job
      but fail to pass the probationary period, and more than three months have passed
      since the resignation.\r\n\r\nUpon the resignation, the employer must notify
      the TGSS through the Import@ss portal, which will issue a certificate of employment
      to be submitted to SEPE within 15 days. This certificate is essential for unemployment
      benefits unless the resignation is voluntary.\r\n\r\n<color=#610078></align=left><size=60>d.
      Dismissal Procedure:</color></size></align>\r\n\r\nIt is crucial to follow
      the correct dismissal procedure to avoid the dismissal being deemed improper.
      The steps include:\r\n\r\n- **Providing written notice:**  \r\n  A written
      notice of 7 days must be given, or 20 days if the employee has been working
      for more than a year. If not provided, these days must be compensated in the
      final settlement.\r\n  \r\n- **Dismissal letter:**  \r\n  A dismissal letter
      must clearly state the reason for termination and include justification for
      the decision. It should not only state the intention to terminate but also
      provide a rationale.\r\n\r\n- **Compensation and final settlement:**  \r\n 
      Compensation of 12 days of salary per year of service, up to six months, must
      be paid, along with the salary for the days worked, unpaid vacation, and other
      entitlements.\r\n\r\n- **Signing documentation:**  \r\n  All documentation
      must be signed by both parties. If the employee refuses to sign, a witness
      should be present to confirm the date of communication, and the documents can
      be sent via certified mail.\r\n\r\nIt is essential to follow these procedures
      to avoid an improper dismissal, which could entitle the employee to a compensation
      of 20 days' salary per year of service, up to a limit of 12 months.\r\n\r\nSOURCES:

      **Royal Decree-Law 16/2022**, of September 6, aimed at improving the working
      conditions and Social Security of household employees, aligns their conditions

      system.\r\n\r\nFrom **October 1, 2022**, unemployment contributions became
      mandatory for household employees. As of **January 2023**, contributions are

      can be considered legally unemployed if their employment is terminated through
      a written communication from the employer, clearly stating:\r\n\r\n\u25CF The
